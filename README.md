### Hi there 👋
Professional bridge builder, with high experience in local government (currently on ViceChairman position) looking to improve technical and creative skills. In exchange for the lack of commercial experience, I offer high qualifications in interpersonal contacts and group management, the ability to quickly find solutions and a strong attitude to perform assigned tasks ;)
